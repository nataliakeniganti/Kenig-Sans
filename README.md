# Hey, what is this font about?
Kenig Sans is a versatile sans-serif with a basic but playful and modern feeling to it.
It's also a new version of Mmy first font, Roboto, but with a few characters fully changed. While Roboto had only one weight, I decided to add eight more styles to this font to make it an actual font family.
# How much characters and languages are in here?
The font has 1413 characters in 298 languages (according to Hyperglot)
# And what's the license?
This font has an OFL license, so you can use if for both personal and commercial use. You can even modify it if you want!
